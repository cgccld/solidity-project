# NFT Marketplace for ERC721 and ERC1155

This is a Solidity project that implements a decentralized NFT marketplace for both ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens, 
with the added feature of lazy minting.

## Features

- NFT Marketplace: The project allows users to buy, sell, and trade both ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens in a 
decentralized manner, without the need for intermediaries.
- ERC721 and ERC1155 Support: The marketplace supports both the ERC721 and ERC1155 token standards, 
which are widely used for non-fungible tokens such as digital art, collectibles, and gaming items.
- Lazy Minting: The project includes the feature of lazy minting, which enables the creation of new tokens
only when they are sold for the first time. This can help reduce the overall cost of minting and deployment, 
as well as provide an efficient way to manage token supply.
